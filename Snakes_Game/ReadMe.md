# Snake Game Using Pygame In Python

- This is a Snake Game created in Python using Pygame module.
- Dive into the classic Snake recreated using the Python Pygame library.
- Leveraged arrays to store the position of each block as 2D Vector and implements features of Pygame library by practicing the Pythonâ€™s OOPs capabilities.
- I tried to add a dockerfile to make a Docker Image of the project so that it can be on other machine without the need to install all required dependencies individually to run the program, but alas no luck....

## Pre-requisites

- Python
- Pygame, an open source Python library for making multimedia applications
## Installation

Download the Python 3 installer package from the official website and install it, if not installed previously.

Run the following in the terminal to install the Pygame library

```bash
pip3 install pygame
```
    
## Run Locally

Download the source code from the repository and run the file just as any other Python script (.py) file.

```bash

```
