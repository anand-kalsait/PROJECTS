<p>This is a Snake Game created in Python using Pygame module.
This was a good project to work on to test my skills as Python programmer.
I tried to add a dockerfile to make a Docker Image of the project so that it can be on other machine without the need to install all required dependencies individually to run the program, but alas no luck....
